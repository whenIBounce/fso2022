# Data For Countries

## API used:
https://restcountries.com

## What this app does:

This app can look at data of various countries.

The user interface is very simple. 

The country to be shown is found by typing a search query into the search field.

### If there are too many (over 10) countries that match the query
then the user is prompted to make their query more specific.

### If there are ten or fewer countries, but more than one
then all countries matching the query are shown. 

### When there is only one country matching the query
then the basic data of the country (eg. capital and area), its flag and the languages spoken there, are shown.
